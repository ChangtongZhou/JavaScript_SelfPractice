## Event Driving

### Multi-processing:

* Multiple systems run their processes \(programs\) at the same time.
* One machine/system runs one process/program, one process has its own resource.
* Processes are independent between each other.
* There are virtual memory is involved

### Multi-threading:

* Multiple threads run on a system/machine at the same time.
* Threads on the same system share the same resources
* No virtual memory is involved
* You need to avoid deadlock
* e.g.
  * browser
  * web server \(each user represents a thread\)

## Event Driven Execution \(JS\):

* Event loop is Single threaded, one task at a time

### Send events aside:

* SetTimeout\(fn, delay\):
  * this is for 'fn' to be eligible to get executed after delayed time. \(fn might not get executed right away after the delayed time reached, b/c it has to wait for the operation stack to be empty and the fn has to be in the begining of event queue\) i.e. fn get placed in the end of event queue from web api pool after delayed seconds.
* SetInterval\(fn, sds\):
  * this is for 'fn' run every 'sds' time

## Blocking operations

## Non-blocking operations:

## Async Programming Methods:

### Callback:

* A function that will be invoked at some point in the future when an operation is completed
* e.g.

```javascript

```

* **Callback hell**:
  * Callbacks are difficult to manage when multiple async calls needed to be sequentialized, or put into some order
  * Usually it appears like nesting callbacks

### Exception Handling:

Deal with error within a controlled mechanism in try/catch block

```javascript
try {
    // try to execute certain operations 
}
catch(e){
    // throw an error if one is caught
}
finally {
    // will always be executed no matter whatever 
}
```

### Throw:

If encounter an error, break code execution right away and throw an error, then it goes to catch block.

### Promise: 

* built on top of callback

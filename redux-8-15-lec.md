# Redux 8-15 Lec

## Todo List Example - Connect React with Redux {#todo-list-example---connect-react-with-redux}

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Redux is not only made for React, but it is a good pair to use with React.

Remember before how we manually use `store.subscribe()` function to register the `render` function, in order to update the UI every time when there is an action dispatched.

```text
const store = createStore(counterReducer);
store.subscribe(render);
```

#### [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) {#react-redux}

`react-redux` is a official binding library to use Redux with React.

Remember that React bindings are not included in Redux by default. You need to install them explicitly:

```text
npm install redux react-redux --save
```

The way we recommend to use Redux with React is to use a special Component `<Provider>` from `react-redux`, to magically make the store available to all React Components in the application without passing it every time. You only need to use it once when you render the root Component:

Let's create a new file `index.js` inside `src`, which will be the entry point for the whole application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';

import store from './store/configureStore';
import App from './containers/App';

render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

We still don't have any React Component defined yet, Let's create our first component. Create a new directory `containers` inside `src`, then create a new directory `App` inside `src/containers`, then create a file `index.js` inside `src/containers/App`.

```jsx
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello World.</div>;
  }
}
```

Now we just need one more step to connect our `App` Component with Redux using `connect()`function from `react-redux`:

To use `connect()`, you need to define a special function called `mapStateToProps` that tells how to transform the current Redux store state into the props you want to pass to a presentational component you are wrapping.

In addition to reading the state, components can dispatch actions. In a similar fashion, you can define a function called `mapDispatchToProps()` that receives the `dispatch()` method and returns callback props that you want to inject into the presentational component.

In `App` Component:

```jsx
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {connect} from 'react-redux';

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.props.setFilter('active');
    }, 5000);
  }
  render() {
    console.log(this.props.todos);
    console.log(this.props.filter);
    return <div>Hello World.</div>;
  }
}

// Note: state here is the state inside of redux
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    todos: state.todos,
    filter: state.filter,
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    setFilter: filter => {
      dispatch({type: 'SET_FILTER', filter: filter});
    },
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
```

* With the function `mapStateToProps`, we are mapping `state.todos` as `props.todos` and `state.filter` as `props.filter` in `App` componnet.
* With the function `mapDispatchToProps`, we are mapping the function `setFilter` as `props.setFilter` in `App` componnet.
* `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` are both optional parameters for the `connect`function. If you passing nothing, nothing will be mapped.

## Action Creator

An action that returns an action is called action creator.

Why do we need it?

* Basic abstraction: reduce duplication, create reusability of an action inside a component
* Documentation: the parameters of the function act as a guide for what data is needed to go into the action.
* Code separation: Consistently using action creators means that a component **doesn't have to know any of the details of creating and dispatching the action**.

## Redux middleware:

It provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer

Why do we need it:

* **Example - Logging**

  It makes state changes predictable and transparent. Every time an action is dispatched, the new state is computed and saved. The state cannot change by itself, it can only change as a consequence of a specific action.

  It is good if we logged every action that happens in the app, together with the state computed after it for development and debugging. When something goes wrong, we can look back at our log, and figure out which action corrupted the state.

* **Manually**

  The most na√Øve solution is just to log the action and the next state yourself every time you call `store.dispatch(action)`. It's not really a solution, but just a first step towards understanding the problem.

  Suppose that you will call this to dispatch an action in the component:

  ```text
  store.dispatch(addTodo('First Todo'));
  ```

  In order to log the action and the state, you have to change the code to:

  ```text
  const action = addTodo('First Todo');
  console.log('dispatching', action);
  store.dispatch(action);
  console.log('next state', store.getState());
  ```

  This produces the desired effect, but you wouldn't want to do it every time though.

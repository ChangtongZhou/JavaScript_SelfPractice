## Middleware:

* A JS function that is plugged in the middle of processing flow
* can manipulate Request 

## Rest API:

* A standard that defines APIs
* One of the modern architectural style of web applications
* A set of design criteria:
  * Not the physical structure \(architecture\) of the system
* Rest is not tied to 'web' only
  * doesn't depend on the mechanics of HTTP
* It is supposed to be 'stateless':
  * The result of one operation doesn't depend on previous operation's result \(no side effect\)

### Resource:

* Anything that's important enough to be referenced as a thing in itself
  * like Objects/ Classes
* Something that can be stored on a computer and represented as a stream of bits:
  * A document
  * A row in DB
  * Output of executing an algorithm/a program
  * Similar to "Object" in OOP

### API Methods:

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

{% hint style="info" %}
GET method doesn't have a returned body
{% endhint %}

* 100% REST architecture is not practical and not valuable either. Need to be unREST at times
  * Benefits of UnREST-ness outweigh adherence to style
* Authentication/Authorization data sent with every request
* Sessions are NOT RESTful \(i.e. sessions = state\)
* Cookies, if used appropriately \(for storing client state\) are RESTful
* Some server frameworks only support GET/POST forcing one to overload POST requests for PUT/DELETE

### REST API Best Practice:

* Prefix endpoints with /api, to differentiate from app routes
* Use a plural  nouns for a url pointing to a collection: `/api/users`
